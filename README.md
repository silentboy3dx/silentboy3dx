### Some Fun Facts about me:


### Fact #1
Despite me showing off my code on Github I am not one of those posh developers you see on Twitter now days showing off their wealth and knollage. I am just a senior Developer period.

### Fact #2
Not many people know that besides me enjoying 3DXChat a lot I am an avid gamer and IRL a lead developer at a European game development studio.
